# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-to-Find-Value-of-Pi
Implemented Monte Carlo Simulation to get value of Pi.

It is an interesting mathematical copncept.

If we place points randomly in a square of length d and a circle and count the number of points that falls inside the square and circle respectively, we can find the value of pi just by comparing their ratios!!!

So how does this work?

If we take the ratios of the area of circle vs area of pi and equal it to the ratio of circle counts and square counts we get:

$$
\frac{\pi r^2}{4r^2} = \frac{\text{points in circle}}{\text{points in square}}
$$

$$
\pi  = 4*\frac{\text{points in circle}}{\text{points in square}}
$$


Isn't that AMAZING?
